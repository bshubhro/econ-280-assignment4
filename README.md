# Tables
View output tables in the tables folder. The table named 'table 2' replicates the original table from the paper. The table titled 'bstable' is the table which replicates the results with bootstrapped standard errors. 

# Extension
In recent literature, using the defualt 'robust' command on stata is under some scrutiny, given that it uses HC(0) standard errors, which might not be the most efficient approach. A recent paper by Young (QJE 2019) discusses this issue and highlights the limitations of this approach.

In the extension, I use bootstrapped standard errors to replicate the original results.

Key Findings:
-Overall, all the co-efficients replicate by using bootstrapped standard errors
-However, the standard errors vary slightly for each of the regressions. But since the changes are marginal, it does not have an impact on the overall significance of the co-efficients.
